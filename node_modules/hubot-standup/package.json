  "readme": "# hubot-standup\n\nAgile style standup bot for [hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot) ala [tender](https://github.com/markpasc/tender).\n\n## How to use\n\nCreate a room (or channel on IRC) for standup (existing one is okay) and invite hubot to the room if necessary.\n\n### Setup\n\nFirst, you tell hubot who is a member for a particular team for the standup, using the `roles` commands with \"(who) is a (team) member\".\n\nLet's take \"engineering\" team for example.\n\n```\nmiyagawa: hubot miyagawa is an engineering member\nhubot: Ok, miyagawa is an engineering member\nmiyagawa: hubot john is an engineering member\nhubot: Ok, john is an engineering member\nmiyagawa: hubot davidlee is an engineering member\nhubot: Ok, davidlee is an engineering member\n```\n\nYou can create as many teams as you want.\n\n**Note**: This setup process hopefully won't be necessary in the future, when Hubot properly implements an API to get the list of online users in a room. So that everyone in a standup room == standup participants.\n\n### Start the standup\n\nHubot won't schedule the standup for you (yet), you have to start it by yourself when it's time.\n\n```\nmiyagawa: hubot standup for engineering\nhubot: Ok, let's start the standup: miyagawa, john, davidlee\nhubot: john: your turn\n```\n\nHubot remembers who should participate the standup, and will tell whose turn is the next. Tell what you did yesterday, will do today, anything blocked. and say \"next\" (or \"done\" or \"that's it\") when you're done.\n\n```\njohn: Done some pretty nice hack yesterday.\njohn: I will work on another cool stuff today.\njohn: I'm not blocked\njohn: hubot next\nhubot: davidlee: your turn\n```\n\nWhen the user is offline or away for a second, tell hubot to skip the user.\n\n```\nmiyagawa: hubot skip davidlee\nhubot: Will skip davidlee\nhubot: miyagawa: your turn\n```\n\nOnce the last user is done, hubot will tell you how long the standup was.\n\n```\nmiyagawa: I'm working on some nice stuff, and will continue doing so today.\nmiyagawa: hubot next\nhubot: All done! Standup was 5 minutes and 24 seconds.\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nThis hubot script depends on `roles.coffee` script. You're recommended to use `redis-brain.coffee` to persist the team information.\n\nIn your `package.json`, add the following line to the dependencies:\n\n```\n   \"hubot-standup\": \"git://github.com/miyagawa/hubot-standup.git\"\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` and create a symbolic link from `scripts` directory:\n\n```\nln -s ../node_modules/hubot-standup/src/scripts/standup.coffee scripts/\n```\n\nAdd the symlink file to the git repository if necessary (for Heroku deployment).\n\n### Yammer\n\nBy symlinking to `standup-yammer.coffee` in addition, the bot will post the standup archive to Yammer. You need to set a valid Yammer OAuth2 token to `HUBOT_STANDUP_YAMMER_TOKEN` environment variable.\n\nHere's how to get a valid Yammer OAuth2 token with the standard OAuth2 authorization flow. \n\nSee [Yammer documentation](https://developer.yammer.com/api/oauth2.html) for more details.\n\n* Register a new application on Yammer at `https://www.yammer.com/<DOMAIN>/client_applications/new`. Leave the callback URLs empty\n* Take notes of your `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret`\n* Make a new bot user on Yammer (optional). This is the user who will post archives as.\n* Sign in as the new bot user on Yammer if necessary\n* Go to `https://www.yammer.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=<consumer_key>`\n* There's an authorization dialog. Authorize the app\n* Look at the URL bar and there's a `code=<CODE>` query parameter in there, copy that.\n* `curl https://www.yammer.com/oauth2/access_token?code=<CODE>&client_id=<consumer_key>&client_secret=<consumer_secret>`\n* you'll get a big JSON that contains `access_token` -> `token`\n\nNow set the token to `HUBOT_STANDUP_YAMMER_TOKEN` and Hubot will ask which group ID the log should be posted to. Use the group ID 0 to turn off the feature for a group.\n\n## Author\n\n[Tatsuhiko Miyagawa](https://github.com/miyagawa)\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\n\n\n",
